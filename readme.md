# pdgmerge

Small CLI to merge PDFs.  In Swift, so probably only works on Mac (might work on Linux?  Maybe?  Dunno.).

Calling options:

```
pdfmerge outfile.pdf
```

merge every pdf file in directory in ABC order to outfile.pdf

```
pdfmerge infile1.pdf infile2.pdf infile3.pdf ... outfile.pdf
```

merges files in the order given

```
pdfmerge infiles.txt outfile.pdf
```

merges files listed line-by-line in infiles.txt

Depending on the PDF files you use, it might warn you with `CoreGraphics PDF has logged an error. Set environment variabe "CG_PDF_VERBOSE" to learn more.` (including the typo!!). That error is probably safe to ignore: in my local development after setting that variable it turns out it's just some random font problem, probably pandoc/latex's fault. `WARNING: Type1 font data isn't in the correct format required by the Adobe Type 1 Font Format specification.`

This is just a learning project, plus because my [original pdf merging cli](https://github.com/paultopia/mergepdfs) seems to get the order wrong sometimes + has an annoying java dependency. Mostly follwing instructions in [this excellent tutorial](https://www.swiftbysundell.com/posts/building-a-command-line-tool-using-the-swift-package-manager) for structuring the project. 

No tests or anything yet.  When I want to learn how to write tests in swift I'll probably put some in. 

Also, no error handling at all, it will blow up horribly if you give it nonexistent files, likely with incomprehensible error messages

However, if you tell it to write to a file that already exists it'll at least be decent enough to refuse to do that.

Not tested on any paths other than current directory, so no promises that it'll work other than on files in the directory you happen to run it in. Please file an issue if that doesn't work though, and I'll learn how paths in swift work.
